This is a, ahem, performance, of the [Gilded Rose Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata), taking the Java version and converting it to Kotlin.

You can see the refactoring on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1ssMPpyqocjo6kkNCg-ncTyAW0nECPmq), and learn more about the techniques shown in  [Java to Kotlin, A Refactoring Guidebook](https://java-to-kotlin.dev/).
